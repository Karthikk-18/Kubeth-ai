## 🚀 Overview

The **AI Research Intelligence Agent** is a multi-agent research automation system designed to search, extract, summarize, validate, and generate final research reports with minimal human input.

This project demonstrates how workflow automation and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) can replace manual browsing, copy-pasting, and summarization.

## 🎯 Goal

> Reduce hours of research into minutes.

Users enter a topic → the system autonomously retrieves information → processes it → and outputs a clean, structured PDF report.
